# ðŸ“ž AI Sales Assistant: Negotiation & Closing Strategy Script and Diagram Generator

## Overview
This **AI Sales Assistant** application is designed to help sales professionals streamline their negotiation and deal-closing processes. Powered by a Large Language Model (LLM) like **chatgpt-4o-mini*, it generates tailored, multi-turn call scripts focused on overcoming objections and securing commitments. The assistant enhances conversations through the application of persuasive principles, providing a structured approach to finalize deals.

## âœ¨ Features
* **Customizable Context:** Generate scripts based on specific industry, buyer persona, product offer, call type, sales objective, and sales framework.
* **Intelligent Framework Selection:** Choose from various sales frameworks (e.g., Challenger, SPIN, MEDDIC) or let the AI automatically select the most suitable one.
* **AI-Generated Negotiation Script:** Produces a dynamic, multi-turn dialogue between an Agent and a Client, complete with simulated objections and persuasive responses.
* **Structured Deal Flowchart:** Provides a clear, visual representation of the typical negotiation and closing process, including common branching paths for handling different client responses.
* **Persuasion Principles:** The AI agent is prompted to incorporate techniques like social proof, scarcity, and urgency triggers within the dialogue to guide the conversation effectively.
* **Branded PDF Export:** Compiles the generated script, key engagement overview (objective, framework), and the deal flowchart into a professionally formatted, downloadable PDF document with customizable logos.
